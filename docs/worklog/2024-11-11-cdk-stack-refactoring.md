# CDK Stack Refactoring: Module System and Runtime Configuration

## Overview
This worklog documents the comprehensive refactoring of the HandTerm CDK stack, addressing module system compatibility, type safety, and runtime configuration challenges.

## Key Modifications

### 1. Module System Improvements
- Resolved conflicts between CommonJS and ES module imports
- Centralized type definitions in `authTypes.ts`
- Ensured consistent import strategies across authentication modules

### 2. TypeScript Configuration Updates
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to support Node.js 20
- Enhanced type checking and strictness
- Improved type safety for lambda integrations

### 3. CDK Stack Refinement
- Fixed unused import and variable warnings
- Ensured proper scoping of variables
- Maintained existing infrastructure deployment logic
- Preserved lambda authorizer and integration configurations

### 4. Runtime Environment Preparation
- Prepared for potential Node.js 20 upgrade
- Maintained compatibility with AWS Lambda
- Kept existing dependency configurations

## Specific Changes
- Restored full implementation of `cdk-stack.ts`
- Resolved undefined variable errors
- Ensured all AWS CDK components are correctly defined
- Maintained comprehensive API endpoint configurations

## Deployment Outcomes
- Successfully deployed CDK stack
- Improved type system robustness
- Maintained existing backend infrastructure functionality

## Potential Future Improvements
- Continued type system refinement
- Gradual migration to ES modules
- Further optimization of lambda integrations

## Lessons Learned
- Careful management of module imports is crucial
- TypeScript configuration requires periodic review
- Maintaining backwards compatibility while modernizing is key
