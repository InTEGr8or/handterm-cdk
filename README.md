# Server Side Cloud Infrastructure and Integration with Terminal

Given that your application is a browser-based TUI using `@xterm/xterm` with React and TypeScript, the use of HttpOnly cookies becomes highly relevant and is indeed a reasonable and recommended approach for handling session tokens and enhancing security.

In a web browser context, HttpOnly cookies are an effective measure to protect your application against XSS attacks because they ensure that the cookies cannot be accessed through client-side scripts. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to user sessions even if an attacker can inject malicious scripts into your web pages.

### Implementing HttpOnly Cookies in Your Scenario

Given your setup, here’s how you can work with HttpOnly cookies for session management:

1. **Server-Side Token Handling**: After a user authenticates, your server (or a serverless backend like AWS Lambda) should handle the token exchange with AWS Cognito. Once you receive authentication tokens from Cognito, you decide which information needs to be stored in cookies.

2. **Setting HttpOnly Cookies**: When your backend sends the authentication response back to the browser, set the session tokens (or session identifiers) as HttpOnly cookies in the response headers. This can be done in your AWS Lambda function that's acting as the backend for authentication. Here’s an example of setting a cookie in a Lambda function response:

    ```typescript
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
            'Set-Cookie': `sessionId=${yourSessionId}; HttpOnly; Secure; Path=/;`,
            // Additional headers as necessary
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            message: 'Authentication successful',
            // Any other response payload
        }),
    };
    return response;
    ```

3. **Secure Attributes**: Note the `Secure` attribute in the cookie, which ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS, further enhancing security. The `Path=/` attribute specifies that the cookie is accessible for every request to your domain.

4. **Client-Side Handling**: On the client side, your React application does not directly access these HttpOnly cookies. Instead, each subsequent request to your server (or serverless backend) will automatically include these cookies (thanks to the browser's cookie handling), where you can validate the session and perform authorized actions.

5. **Logout and Session Expiry**: Ensure you implement mechanisms for users to log out and to automatically expire sessions after a certain period or inactivity. This can involve server-side logic to invalidate session identifiers or tokens.

### Security Considerations

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Enhance your application's security by implementing a Content Security Policy header to reduce the risk of XSS attacks.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Although HttpOnly cookies are not accessible via JavaScript, ensure your application is also protected against CSRF attacks. This might involve CSRF tokens or validating the `Origin` and `Referer` headers for state-changing requests.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Be mindful of your CORS policy to ensure your application does not inadvertently allow unsafe cross-origin requests.

Implementing HttpOnly cookies in a browser-based TUI application for secure session management is indeed a good practice. Ensure you follow best practices for security and privacy to protect user data and sessions effectively.


## Secrets In Parameter Store

```sh
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/github/secrets" --type "String" --value
 '{"clientId":"your_client_id","clientSecret":"your_client_secret","issuerUrl":"your 
 ssuer_url"}' --overwrite
 ```

## To include a layer

The best way to deal with layers is to avoid needing one if you can. Use AWS layers if those will solve your problem.

Otherwise, create a layer sub-folder like this: `my-custom-layer/nodejs/`, go into the `nodejs` subfolder and run `yarn init --yes` and then `yarn add <needed library>` and then include the `my-custom-layer/` in the CDK as a layer resourse.

## CDK Synthesis and Validation

1. CDK Synthesis Completion: Yes, once the CDK is synthesized, most of the work on the development machine 
   is indeed complete. The synthesis process has transformed your high-level CDK code into a CloudFormation
   template.
2. Deployment Process: The next step is to deploy this synthesized template to AWS. This is where the      
   actual resources get created or updated in your AWS account.
3. Alternative Deployment Method: You're right that you could theoretically deploy the synthesized
   CloudFormation template directly using the AWS CLI with a command like:
   
    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file <path-to-synthesized-template> --stack-name <your-stack-name 
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   
   However, using cdk deploy is generally recommended as it handles some additional tasks like packaging   
   assets (e.g., Lambda function code) and uploading them to S3.
4. Lambda Function Validation: Regarding validating Lambda functions in a CDK project, there isn't a direct
   equivalent to SAM's local-invoke command built into the CDK. However, there are a few approaches you can
   take:
   a. Use AWS SAM CLI with CDK: You can actually use SAM CLI with CDK projects. After synthesizing your CDK
   app, you can use SAM CLI commands on the resulting template. For example:
   
    cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml
    sam local invoke <FunctionName> -t template.yaml
   
   b. Use the aws-lambda-local npm package: This package allows you to invoke Lambda functions locally.    
   c. Write unit tests: You can write unit tests for your Lambda function code using frameworks like Jest. 
   d. Use the AWS Lambda console: After deployment, you can test your functions directly in the AWS Lambda 
   console.
